# Amalgamator Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Amalgamator web application.

## 1. Testing Approach

The testing approach for Amalgamator follows a comprehensive strategy that includes:

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components and functions in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between components and API endpoints
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows from start to finish

## 2. Test Environment Setup

### Backend Testing
- Test database: MongoDB test instance
- Test framework: Jest
- API testing: Supertest

### Frontend Testing
- Component testing: React Testing Library
- State management testing: Redux Mock Store
- End-to-End testing: Selenium WebDriver

## 3. Test Categories

### 3.1 Backend Tests

#### Authentication Tests
- User registration
- User login
- Token validation
- Protected route access

#### Amalgamation Tests
- Creating amalgamations
- Retrieving amalgamations
- Updating amalgamation status
- Random amalgamation selection

#### Contribution Tests
- Adding contributions
- Retrieving contributions
- Updating contributions
- Voting on contributions

#### Business Logic Tests
- Timer restrictions
- Contribution points system
- Badge awarding

### 3.2 Frontend Tests

#### Component Tests
- Rendering of all major components
- User interaction with forms
- Navigation between pages
- State management

#### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user registration and login flow
- Amalgamation creation flow
- Contribution and voting flow
- Dashboard and profile navigation

## 4. Test Execution

### Running Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Running Frontend Component Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Running End-to-End Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

### Running All Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## 5. Continuous Integration

For future implementation, the following CI workflow is recommended:

1. Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
2. Run end-to-end tests before merging to main branch
3. Deploy to staging environment after successful tests on main branch
4. Run smoke tests on staging environment
5. Deploy to production after manual approval

## 6. Test Coverage Goals

- Backend code coverage: 80%+
- Frontend component coverage: 70%+
- Critical user flows: 100%

## 7. Test Maintenance

Tests should be maintained and updated whenever:
- New features are added
- Existing features are modified
- Bugs are fixed (with regression tests)
- UI changes significantly
