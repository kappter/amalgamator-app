## Tips and Best Practices

### Writing Effective Contributions

- Be concise but specific (remember the 255 character limit)
- Focus on the relationship between the concepts, not just describing them
- Consider multiple perspectives (scientific, cultural, metaphorical)
- Use examples to illustrate your point
- Avoid vague statements like "these are similar" without explanation

### Using Contribution Points Strategically

- Save points for exploring connections you're particularly interested in
- Consider using points when you have limited time but want to continue exploring
- Build up a reserve of points before deep-diving into a specific topic

### Exploring Different Modes

- **For learning**: Start with Play Mode to discover new concepts
- **For expertise**: Use Focus Mode with concepts you know well
- **For creativity**: Use Innovator Mode when looking for inspiration
- Try all three modes to get the full Amalgamator experience
